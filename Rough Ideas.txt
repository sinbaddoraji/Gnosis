methods won't specify the parameters
eg:
	call(name="sam",skill=true)
The method call will be initalized using those variables and values

method return is always dynamic

value type will always be unspecified. Use of "var" keyword

var dada = kik();
 what ever kik can return anything

booleans do not allow ((a == b) || (b == c))
Correct syntax: (a == b || b == c)
"!" to be implemented later on

put boolean expressions in variables if it is to be sepretated carefully

for loop will be translated into a while loop in the intepreter.. 
 (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) 

the first command will be run
the second will be the condition
and the third will be run after every cycle

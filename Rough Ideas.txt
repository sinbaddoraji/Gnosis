method return is always dynamic

value type will always be unspecified. Use of "var" keyword

var dada = kik;
 what ever kik can return anything

booleans do not allow ((a == b) || (b == c))
Correct syntax: (a == b || b == c)
"!" to be implemented later on


methods in Main are global and can be accessed in every method but not vice versa
except variable created by using var public
